The Haskell News page with hdiff links

Synopsis
===

    $ open index.html
    $ open index2.html

These are alternate versions of the Haskell News page
which adds a few convenience features:

- Hackage news items have an __(hdiff)__ link to
  Luite Stegman's hdiff Hackage mirror so you can see
  what changed in a package

- __index2.html__ has controls to toggle viewing of
news items by category -- e.g. Reddit, Haskell Cafe, Hackage, etc.
