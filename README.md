A mash-up of Haskell News and Luite Stegeman's hdiff site.

__Synopsis__

    $ git clone https://github.com/erantapaa/haskellnews-hdiff
    $ open haskellnews-hdiff/index.html
    $ open haskellnews-hdiff/index2.html

These are alternate versions of the Haskell News page
which adds a few convenience features:

- Hackage news items have an __(hdiff)__ link to
  Luite Stegman's hdiff Hackage mirror so you can see
  what changed in a package

- __index2.html__ has controls to toggle viewing of
news items by category -- e.g. Reddit, Haskell Cafe, Hackage, etc.
