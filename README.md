The Haskell News page with hdiff links

This alternate version of the Haskell News page adds links
to Luite Stegeman's Hackage mirror so you can see what
changed in a package.

Simply open `index.html` in your browser. Hackage news items will
have a __(hdiff)__ link which will link to the diffs page for
that version of the package.
